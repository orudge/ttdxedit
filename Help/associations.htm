<h1>File Associations</h1>

<p>Associating files to certain programs allows for direct access in Explorer. If you select a movie clip, for example, it is loaded into a program capable of playing it. Transport Tycoon saved games have no association by default - they are unknown to Windows. However this editor can assign itself to the saved games so they can be loaded by simply double-clicking them in Explorer.</p>
<p>You can associate TT saved games with files by selecting the <b>File Assocations</b> item from the <b>Options</b> menu. You can select which of TTD's filetypes you want to associate. If another program (such as Transport Tycoon Saved Game Manager) has associated itself with some or all of the filetypes, you can choose to overwrite the settings or simply 'blend in' with them. After setting this up you'll find some new options in the right-click pop-up menu for these types of files:</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Edit with TTDX Editor</b><br>
Opens the selected game for editing with TTDX Editor.</li>
   <li><b>Repack to Game Format</b><br>
Decompresses and then recompresses the selected game. This fixes the problem when loading saved games from the Windows version of TTD into the DOS version.</li>
   <li><b>Make Unpacked File</b><br>
Decompresses the selected game into its unpacked form. This will create a <b>.s??dta</b> and <b>.s??hdr</b> file for the game (where .s?? is the current extension - eg, .sv1).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<p>Selecting the "plug-in" option does NOT change the default action of the filetype(s). It simply places the TTDX Editor options into the menu.</p> 
<p>There is no option to remove the associations yet. This will be added in a future version of TTDX Editor.</p>
