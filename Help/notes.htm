<h1>Notes and Limitations</h1>

<p>While TTDAlter is a very flexable application, there are some limitations you should be aware of. Many of these are due to the way Transport Tycoon Deluxe is coded, and there is no way around them.</p>

<p>You should be aware that saved games store the vehicle characteristics for all the vehicles. This means that, to update your vehicles in an old game, you must replace the vehicles. However, once the updated vehicles have been built, they will be stored in the saved game, so you can still play the game on an unaltered version of TTD or on one with different vehicle settings.</p>

<p>If you use TTDPatch, you can use the <b>ReloadEngines</b> sign cheat (<b>ResetVehicles</b> in TTDPatch 1.9.1 or higher) to reload the vehicle parameters.</p>

<p>Please also note that the TTDPatch new vehicles take prescedence over the old TTD ones, and you cannot currently use TTDAlter to change these. A plug-in for this will be developed once a stable version of TTDPatch 1.9.1 has been released.</p>

<p>There are various limitiations in the maximum speeds, capacities, and so on. These are as follows:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">

   </tr>
</table>

<p>You will see some inconsistancies between your settings and those shown when you are creating new vehicles at a depot.  For example, a 20,000mph train will show a maximum speed of 3616mph. This is to do with the way TTD translates the value to show from the value stored. Don't worry! Your altered value is still being used.</p>

<p><b>Other Limitations</b></p>

<ul>
   <li><b>Bridges</b> are limited to a maximum speed of 2,260mph  (3,616 km/h)</li>
   <li><b>Industries</b> are limited to a maximum production of 2,040/2,295 tonnes (204,000/229,500 litres)</li>
   <li><b>Disasters</b> can only occur between 1900 and 2100. TTDPatch 1.9.1 extends this maximum to the year 2155</li>
</ul>
