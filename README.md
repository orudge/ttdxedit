## TTDX Editor
This repository contains the source code to TTDX Editor, a tool for editing Transport Tycoon Delxuxe (and TTDPatch) saved games and scenarios. It was originally written by Jens Vang Peterson, and has been sporadically updated and maintained by Owen Rudge since 2002. You can read more about the software at https://www.transporttycoon.net/ttdxedit.

## Licence
The source code to TTDX Editor was released in October 2017 under the GNU General Public Licence version 2. Please respect this licence should you choose to fork or re-release this code.

## Source code and development environment
The code is written in Visual Basic 6, and the code currently makes use of a number of third-party ActiveX controls. These are primarily TimoSoft controls (https://www.timosoft-software.de/), which are free of charge.

The code has not in any way been tidied up for public release. The last released version of TTDX Editor was version 1.20; the current master represents a development version of the code, which included work adding support for Unicode controls (for translation/text entry purposes, where appropriate). It may be buggy or incomplete - it may not even compile. The documentation that gets shipped with the Setup program has NOT been updated to indicate that the code is now licensed under the GPL - if you happen to want to release a new version (or have code that you'd like me to release as part of a new version), please do ensure the documentation is updated appropriately.

If you have any queries, feel free to drop me (Owen Rudge) an e-mail and I will be happy to try to help.

## C# rewrite
A few years ago I began attempting to rewrite TTDX Editor in C#. This is a work-in-progress, but should sufficient progress be made, I will update this repository with the new code.
