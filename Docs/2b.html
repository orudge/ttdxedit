Associating files to certain programs allowes for direct access in explorer, so if you select a movie clip
it's loaded into a program capable of playing it. TTD savegame have no association by default, they are
unknown to windows. However this editor can assign itselve to the savegames so they can be loaded simply by
doubleclicking them in explorer.<P>
In the "options" menu you'll find this posibility, you can also select which of TTD's filetypes you want
to activate, and in case some other program (like the Savegame manager) have the filetypes, you can choose
to overwrite the settings or simply blend in with them. After setting up you'll find some new options in the 
pop-up menu for the affected files, I think most of them speaks for themselves. The "repack" option for 
savegames might sound a bit useless though, but is intended to fix the problem when loading savegames from 
the Windows version of the game into the Dos-version.<P><BR><P>

Selecting the "plug-in" option does NOT change the default action (double-click) of the filetype(s), 
it simply places the TTDX Edit options into the menu and nothing else..<P>
There's no option to remove the associations included yet. (ofcourse you can have another program 
grabbing the filetypes, or remove them by hand..)
