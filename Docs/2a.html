<TR><TD>
Our favorite game only uses 1 fileformat for saving the games and scenarios, so it's also posible to load
a scenario file into this editor and change some settings, however not all editing options apply to a
scenario file becourse no players have been defined in such a game..<P>
These file-extensions are used by the game:
<UL>
<LI><B>.ss0</B>: Built-in scenario.
<LI><B>.ss1</B>: Built-in save-game.
<LI><B>.sv0</B>: Player created scenario.
<LI><B>.sv1</B>: Normal save-game.
<LI><B>.sv2</B>: Multiplayer save-game.
</UL>

<TR><TD CLASS=TD1>(Un)Compressing</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
TTD compresses it's data in a rather simple way, unfortually is this also the only way it knows how to
handle. So the files have to be saved compressed for the game to be able to load them. This editor have
options to save (and load) the files uncompressed as well, this is targeted at people who wants to do further
editing by hand. After editing the file must then be loaded back in the editor and saved in the format known by 
TTD. If the filetypes have been associated with the editor both uncompressing and compressing options are
included in the right-click menu in explorer.<P>

Files saved uncompressed uses the original name but adds "hdr" and "dta" to the extension so a ".sv1" files 
becomes ".sv1hdr" and ".sv1dta". The hdr files contains the header information for the game, this is just the 
displayname of the game, there's usually nothing to change here. The dta files contains all the data from the 
actual savegame, offsets listed in the techinfo window points directly here..<P>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD CLASS=TD1>NOTES</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
The editor (just like the game) depends on the extensionnames for identification, in addition also the
uncompressed size is used for identification of the files.. <P>
There is a problem when using games and scenarios saved in the windows version of TTD in the ms-dos
version. This can be fixed by loading the file into this editor and then saved again.<P>
