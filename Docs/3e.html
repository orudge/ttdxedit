<TR><TD CLASS=TD1>Cargo Ratings</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
The checkmark at each cargo is intended for use with the "selectgoods" option in TTDPatch, removing it will preform 
a reset of just that type of cargo in this station, unlike the "cht:resetstation" in TTDPatch that'll reset all 
cargo everywhere...

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD CLASS=TD1>Add Buildings</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
Warning: This option have only been tested in tempare climate, and I think it'll preform badly elsewhere.<P>
This will fill all unused squares in the catchment area with buildings, make sure you reserve any areas you'll 
need in the future before using this. In case you wish the city to look natural you'll also need to make some roads 
in the area prior to using the option.<P>
Note: The editor map is NOT updated after using this option, so the new buildings ain't visible until the map is
refreshed, you can do this by reselecting the mapsize in the options menu.<P>
Note: To insure everything in the game is updated proberly the buildings are placed "under construction", once the 
game finishes the buildings, the statistics and cargo are updated.

<TR><TD CLASS=TD1>Add Rem(ote) Part</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
This option will place a bus or truck stop at a location away from the station, this can ofcourse be used instead of
"walking" a station, but the new location don't have to be at the same height as the rest of the station. Unfortunally
this requires a bit preparations first.
<P><HR><P>
1) Make sure the station havn't got a bus or truck station, if it have neither then you can make 2 remote parts in 
one go. 
Note that the busstop will be placed before the truckstop !!
<P><HR><P>
2) Pick the spot for the remote part, <B>it must be within the catchment area of a part of the station.</b>
(That's max 4 squares away). The function is a rather low-level one for the time be, so the entrence to the new 
part is always to the NE. Build this on the square:<BR>

<P><HR><P>

3) Now load the game into this editor, select the station and hit the button...
<P><HR><P>
Hint: It's perfectly legal to use the catchment area of one remote part to set the next.

<TR><TD CLASS=TD1>Future plans (Send a mail if you've got more ideas)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
Make the remote parts "turn" towards any roads.<BR>
Placing railroad station-tracks "remote".<BR>
Pick the spot for remote part directly on a map.<BR>
