 Commandline options are not often seen in Windows programs, yet most actually have them. For completion the
 ones accepted by TTDX Edtior are shown here, they are mainly used when selecting files in explorer, but
 could be used by other programs to launch the editor with specific files. (The plugin for Savegame Manager
 do just that)<P>
 <B>%filepath%</B><BR>
 Loads the file directly into the editor, both normal TTD files and uncompressed hdr/dta may be used.<P>
 <B>%filepath% /S</B><BR>
 Loads the file and saves it again in normal savegame format, besides a quick way of getting a hand-edited
 file back into the game it can also be used for fixing games saved in the TTD-Windows that won't load in
 the Dos version. The editor itselve won't show on screen.<P>
 <B>%filepath% /SU</B><BR>
 Converts the file to uncompressed format.<P>
