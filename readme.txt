TTDX Editor is an editor for Transport Tycoon Deluxe saved games. You can
edit player data, the terrain, cities, industries, stations, vehicles and
more.

INSTALLATION
============

Installation of TTDX Editor is a simple matter. Generally, you should just be
able to run the installer, and everything will be set up for you. You will need
administrator privileges to do this on modern versions of Windows, however.

If you are using Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000 or NT 4.0, you may need an update to
your Windows Scripting Host libraries for TTDX Editor to function properly. WSH
is no longer bundled with TTDX Editor due to most people using Windows XP or
higher by now, which includes it by default. If you are running an older version
of Windows, though, you can download the libraries from my web site, at:

   http://www.transporttycoon.net/ttdxedit

Additionally, Windows 95 users should have the DCOM95 libraries installed. You
can also download these from the above site. Please ensure they are installed
before you install TTDX Editor.

USING TTDX EDITOR
=================

TTDX Editor should be relatively self-explanatory to use. Additional documentation
is unfortunately not available in this version. Please e-mail me (see below) if
you have any questions on program usage.

Please note that TTDX Editor only works with Transport Tycoon Deluxe and TTDPatch
saved games and scenarios. It does not currently support games from the original
Transport Tycoon, the "World Editor" add-on pack, or OpenTTD.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

- Sometimes, road vehicles, ships, aircraft or some combination of the three will
  not show up in the vehicle list. This may be fixed in a future release.

MODIFIED.EXE
============

A small program has been included with TTDX Editor that will tell you if a game
has been modified by TTDX Editor 1.10.14 or higher. MODIFIED.EXE is a command-line
Win32 program, and the syntax of the program is:

   MODIFIED filename

'filename' should be an uncompressed ('big') Transport Tycoon Deluxe saved game or
scenario (eg, created by 'Save Uncompressed' in TTDX Editor, or decoded with SV1Codec).

However, using the "save uncompressed" option in TTDX Editor would actually mark the
decompressed game as being modified by the Editor (even if it hasn't had anything done
to it), which could be a bit unhelpful. Version 1.20 of TTDX Editor makes a note in
the saved game of which game areas have been modified (e.g., city data, vehicle data,
etc). This can be viewed with MODIFIED.EXE.

SV1Codec can be downloaded from http://www.owenrudge.net/redirect/ttdxedit/sv1codec/
if you wish to decode your games manually for use with MODIFIED.EXE.
