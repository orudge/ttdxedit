TTDX Editor is an editor for Transport Tycoon Deluxe saved games. You can
edit player data, the terrain, cities, industries, stations, vehicles and
more.

INSTALLATION
============

Two versions of TTDX Editor 1.10.17 are available - one with an installation
program and one without. If you have downloaded the version with an installation
program, simply run the program you downloaded to install the Editor. If you
downloaded the version without an installation program, please note that the
program requires the following to run:

- VISUAL BASIC 6.0 SP5 RUN-TIME LIBRARIES:
  These are available from http://tinyurl.com/lp9x

- INTERNET EXPLORER 6.0 <OR> WINDOWS SCRIPT 5.6 LIBRARIES:
  Downloads available for the following operating systems:

  Windows 98, Me, NT 4.0: http://tinyurl.com/7zh0
  Windows 2000/XP: http://tinyurl.com/7fxd

- TTDX EDITOR CONTROL PACK
  You also need the MSCOMCTL.OCX and COMDLG32.OCX files to be in your
  Windows\System (system32 on Windows NT/2000/XP) directory. If they are not
  present, download the TTDX Editor Control Pack from http://tinyurl.com/3e7oj.

USING TTDX EDITOR
=================

TTDX Editor should be relatively self-explanatory to use. Documentation will be
made available soon. Please e-mail me (see below) if you have any questions on
program usage.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

- Sometimes, road vehicles, ships, aircraft or some combination of the three will
  not show up in the vehicle list. This should be fixed in the near future.

MODIFIED.EXE
============

A small program has been included with TTDX Editor that will tell you if a game
has been modified by TTDX Editor 1.10.14 or higher. MODIFIED.EXE is a command-line
Win32 program, and the syntax of the program is:

   MODIFIED filename

'filename' should be an uncompressed ('big') Transport Tycoon Deluxe saved game or
scenario (eg, created by 'Save Uncompressed' in TTDX Editor, or decoded with SV1Codec).
However, using the "save uncompressed" option in TTDX Editor would actually mark the
decompressed game as being modified by the Editor (even if it hasn't had anything done
to it), so that would be a bit unhelpful. SV1Codec can be downloaded from
http://www.owenrudge.net/redirect/ttdxedit/sv1codec/.
