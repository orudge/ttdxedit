BUGS
----

- No aircraft shown in vehicle list
- Describe "add buildings"

okay when i open up the stations altering thing i alter the settings but when i close the window then open it again the settings don't seem to be modified 

 
- Morevehicles = 40 = crash - FIXED

- Add Save As function [TODO: Check this]

Only trains show up in the vehicle editor 

And sometimes when i edit the engines cargo capcity the overall weight of the train can get screwed up

--------------
Did a lot more testing this morning, and found following: 

(a) Unable to edit Cities in Scenarios. 
(b) Need to disable ability to change active vehicle consists eg coal to 
mail. 

A suggestion: 
Perhaps when saving have it default to a new copy of file, to protect against unintended results.
